.SH NAME
visgrep \- Visual grep, greps for images in another image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B visgrep
.I "[options] image.png detect.png match.png ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B visgrep
is a program that greps for image in another image.
.PP
The detect.png and match.png files can also be .pat files.
.PP
All .pat files are created using
.B png2pat(1)
or
.B rgb2pat(1)\c
\&. The image.png is scanned for detect.pat starting from X,Y given in parameters.
When detect.pat is found, then all the match.pat files are scanned at an offset of
x,y given in parameters. If a match is found, then
.B visgrep
prints the x,y and index of the item.
.PP
For example, image.png is a screenshot and match1.pat .. match5.pat are images of
letters a to e. Each of these letters is enclosed in a blue box, so detect.pat is
an image of the upper left corner of the box. This box is not included in the
match*.pat files, so they are actually offset 5 pixels down and 4 pixels to the left.
You might run it like this then:
.TP
  visgrep \-x\-4 \-y5 image.png match_corner.pat match_a.pat match_b.bat ...
.PP
Etc, with all matches listed. Now suppose the screen showed ace so visgrep might output:
.sp
.br
  10,10 0
.br
  50,10 2
.br
  90,10 4
.PP
Showing that match_a.pat (index 0) is at 10,10 on the screen. If no match is found even
though the detection image is found, the index will be \-1.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-x

.TP
.B \-X

.TP
.B \-Y
Start scanning at Y.
.TP
.B \-t

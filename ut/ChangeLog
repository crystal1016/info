        * version bump

2009-04-14    Marco Steinacher <msteinacher@websource.ch>
        * Patch related to debian bug #523199, fixes group/shift
          modifier bug for different keyboard layouts and also adds
          multi_key sequences.

2008-03-17    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Version bump
        * Use the keycode index we're working from in the current keysym
          map instead of doing another keysym lookup so that our
          modifiers map to the proper keycodes in the case where a
          keysem might have different keycodes with different modifiers
          (e.g. less = keycode 59 + shift or keycode 94 with no
          modifiers)
        * Show keycode we got in debug
        * Fixed format to be char not string so we don't crash
        * Enable debug by default

2008-01-23    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Add missing manpages to dist, bump version

        * Bump version
        * Fix some compile warnings, add not about where to get window
          id and that it must be in hex
        * Patch to clean up the linking to only use the libs needed and
          added the manpages from the debian project thanks to the
          maintainer Kapil Hari Paranjape

2007-12-04    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * More comments and warnings thanks to mncharity@vendian.org
        * This should allow the source and match to be the same size and
          also adds some extra warning/errors, thanks to
          mncharity@vendian.org
        * Added non-portable image message
        * Spacing changes
        * Added xmousepos
        * Small app to get mouse position
        * Fixed up the key and str commands, now key is specifically for
          sending a keysym, and str is specifically to (attempt) to send
          the characters in a string.

2007-10-01    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * This patch changes causes xte to query the current keyboard
          layout instead of using a hardcoded table and also adds
          unicode support, big thanks to Marco Steinacher

2006-05-18    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Added dist-info config for my mkdist command
        * Changed CFLAGS to AM_CFLAGS

          autoconf/automake, fixed XFlush bug in 'str' command pointed
          out by thorsten@staerk.de

          ais.com>

2004-04-27    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Fixed segfault bug when running without exit, prints error
          message now

2004-04-21    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Inc'd version
        * James Cameron <quozl@us.netrek.org> * visgrep.c: change exit
          status to match grep(1) style; zero for successful match, 1
          for no match, 2 for command error. Wrap usage message for 80
          column default.

2003-12-15    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>
        * Inc'd release number
        * On powerpc, the program loops with "Unhandled option" error.
          This is due to the fact that getopt returns an int and not a
          char (which is too small to contain EOF = -1). The attached
          patch corrects this as well as many warnings about undeclared
          functions and unused variables.

2003-09-16    Steve Slaven <bpk@hoopajoo.net>

          Stefan Nickl

          Saunders

          Tom Bradley
